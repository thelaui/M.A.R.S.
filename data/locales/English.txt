023 In year 3547, civilizations all over the galaxy have settled their own planets, living in peace and harmony with its environment.  \nBut outside the contemplative habitats, the GREAT WAR is raging.  \nAs a famous fighter on your way to never ending honor and prosperity, you have to protect your planet from the oncoming doom of your jealous  \nneighbours! Fight the battle, a true hero as you are was born for: SPACEBALL. \nProtect your planet from the sphere of death and defeat your enemies by letting it crush into their ridiculous globe.
024 Kick or shoot the ball to your enemy's planet!
025 As a result of the GREAT WAR you have lost everything: your home, your family and \nyour self-esteem. \nYour last chance to get out of the miserable life you are stuck in, is to become a gladiator in the glorious \nDEATHMATCH-arena. \nResist the other fighters and earn points by destroying the nutshells, they call ships. \nPrepare yourself! \nDeath and Glory awaits you.
026 Destroy as many enemies as possible!
027 The negotiations have failed! \nBoth of you and your neighbours had to record enormous losses in conclusion of the abiding GREAT WAR. \nAs a last attempt of gaining the upper hand, you are ordered to decimate your enemy's resources and to protect your own one's. The only way to do so is an epic TEAMDEATHMATCH. \nProtect your comrades and destroy your enemies! \nTeach them a lesson, they will never forget.
028 Destroy es many enemies as possible!
029 As if the GREAT WAR was not enough, your planetary system is threatened by a new source of incredible evilness: A giant ship of unknown invaders is levitating over your galaxy, aiming on the home planets with a monolithic weapon of mass destruction. \nAs a sign of cynicism, the attackers dropped a remote control to adjust this provenance of death and fear. \nReach it first to turn your enemy's home planet into a place of desolation! \nBe the CANNONKEEPer.
030 Pick up the remote and keep it as long as possible!

107 Welcome, Space Rookie!
108 We are glad to recruit a rising hero like you to join us in the GREAT WAR!\nWe figured out you needed some practice with your new ship.\nLet the training begin...

109 Basic Movement...
110 Controlling your ship is the most important task to master.\nAll movement is governed by the laws of gravity. To decelerate you have to turn and accelerate in the opposite direction. Control your ship, using the keys

111 Warming Up!
112 Reach the pink zone!\nTry not to crash your brand new ship.

113 Well Done!
114 Now head back to your home planet and try to land your ship by slowly floating back while approaching your planet.

115 Good Work!
116 Proper landing is not a piece of cake, is it?\nYou should learn it by heart.

117 Something More Difficult...
118 Try to follow the path marked up by the pink zones!\n\nWe will contact you again, after you have mastered this. Now go for it!

119 Awesome!
120 You are the best rookie I have ever seen.\nNow prepare yourself for some explosive stuff.

121 Shooting...
122 To defeat your enemies, you have to know how to shoot them up!\nFor that purpose press
123 Have some fun shooting around and then land your ship to continue the tutorial.

124 Good Landing!
125 You turn out to be a great pilot.\n\nNow how about some more weapons?

126 The Weapons...
127 I know you've been waiting for this. When docked you can switch through some incredibly evil weapons.\nPress
128 to open your arsenal.\nThen use
129 to choose a weapon! Take-off, when you're ready!

130 Fight!
131 Now let's see how you make it against a rookie from another planet.\nSeems like he is trying to improve his flying abilities.\nBeat him!

132 Impressive!
133 You did it! As you may have noticed, you gain some reputation points for each killed enemy.\nThe little green number popping up over your ship represents the amount. It will increase if you kill a lot of enemies in row.

134 Beware!
135 There is no time for rest.\nOur enemies have sent one of their real warriors for vengeance!\nThere is nothing I can do for you...

136 Unbelievable!

137 You managed all my tasks successfully. Now what to do?\nLet's have a look at the options menu. There you can adjust a lot of... well... options.\nFor example you may choose your ship style and color or change your name...

138 Who's best?
139 You can display a list of frags, points and so on via <Tab>.\nFurthermore the numbers next to your name illustrate your frag counter and your distance to the best one. 

140 Congratulations!
141 You finished this tutorial. You are now ready to fight in the GREAT WAR. If you want to continue practising, just wait for the enemy to re-spawn. You can end your training with <Esc>.\n\nHave a great time with M.A.R.S.!

142 You Failed!
143 Awesome, you destroyed your brand new ship! All right, we will get you a new one. Just wait some seconds...

144 Did You Notice?
145 Your life is draining! Keep an eye on the green life bar. You better land if it's too empty.

146 Did You Notice?
147 Your fuel is draining! Keep an eye on the yellow fuel bar. You better land if it's too empty.

148 You Nearly Got Him!
149 Watch your opponent's name. Its colour indicates his life points. The more it turns red, the weaker your enemy is.
